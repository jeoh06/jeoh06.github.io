                        ROOM-EZ is a no-frills service linking hosts with housing or rooms to rent 
                        and renters looking for a place in Korea anywhere from a month to a year.
                        Whether you're a host or a renter, post your profile and look for potential matches
                        <br>
                        Created and developed by 7 unique individuals, ROOM-EZ plans to alleviate our users' stress
                        which allows them to focus solely on other aspects of their travels.
                        <br>
                        ROOM-EZ's vast location of housing means we have what you are looking for, be it centrally located,
                        in a quite neighborhood in the city, and even in the provinces for you to enjoy the richness
                        of Korea's nature.
                        <br>
                        While all 7 individuals come from all corners of the world, the common passion for traveling (and coding)
                        has led to the creation of ROOM-EZ.
